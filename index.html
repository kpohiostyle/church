                <h3>Global Scope</h3>
                <p>“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
                    pray for them
                    which despitefully use you, and persecute you” (Matthew 5:43–44)</p>
                <p>For generations, Jews had been taught to hate their enemies, and they were then suffering under the
                    domination and
                    cruelties of Roman occupation. Yet Jesus taught them, <strong>“Love your enemies”</strong> and
                    <strong>“do
                        good to them that
                        … despitefully use
                        you.”</strong>

                    Bring forth the record
                    What revolutionary teachings for personal and political relationships! But that is still what our
                    Savior commands. In
                    the Book of Mormon we read, “For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of
                    contention is not of me, but
                    is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend
                    with anger, one with
                    another” (3 Nephi 11:29).

                <h3>Local Scope</h3>
                <p>How can we apply this principle in our community?</p>
                <p>What distractions do we have in our community?</p>
                <p>President Thomas S. Monson taught that anger is “Satan’s tool,” for “to be angry is to yield to the
                    influence of Satan.
                    No one can make us angry. It is our choice.”5 Anger is the way to division and enmity. We move
                    toward loving our
                    adversaries when we avoid anger and hostility toward those with whom we disagree. It also helps if
                    we are even willing
                    to learn from them.</p>
